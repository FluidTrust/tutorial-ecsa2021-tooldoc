   Simple allocation diagram

The allocation diagram consists of the resources already specified in the :doc:`resource environment <sirius-resource>` and the system parts, of which the system consists. The system parts are the assemblies used while creating the system model using the :doc:`assembly editor <sirius-assembly>`. Assemblies are located within the resource containers to visualize their deployment onto the corresponding resources.
