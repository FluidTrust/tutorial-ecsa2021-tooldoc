Documentation of Confidentiality Modeling and Analysis in Palladio
==================================================================

This documentation briefly explains the tooling that can be used to model and analyze confidentiality in software architectures based on Palladio :cite:p:`main-reussner2016a`.

The suggested reading path is staring with the :doc:`first-start` and deciding how to proceed from there. You may also only use this manual to look up terms or features using the search.

.. note::
   Please note that the manual only covers a part of the overall modeling and analysis approach. Even if the underlying implementation supports all published concepts :cite:p:`main-DBLP:conf/icsa/SeifermannHR19` :cite:p:`main-DBLP:conf/secrypt/SeifermannHWR21` :cite:p:`main-DBLP:conf/icsa/HahnerSHWBH21`, the user interface for end-users is not fully implemented yet.
